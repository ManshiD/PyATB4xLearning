Question 3
Write a program to get two integer inputs, assign them to variables, perform Exponential, Modulus, and Floor Division on the two inputs, and print the results on each line.
Input:
Two integers num1 and num2 (-10^9 ≤ num1, num2 ≤ 10^9).
Output:
Print the results of Exponential, Modulus, and Floor Division on each line.
Sample Input:
5
2

Sample Output:
25
1
2.5

num1=-10^9

num2=10^9

"""
modulus
The modulus-function computes the remainder of a division, which is the "leftover" of an integral division.

floor
The floor-function provides the lower-bound of an integral division. 
The upper-bound is computed by the ceil function. (Basically speaking, the floor-function cuts off all decimals).
